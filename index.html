		<h4 class="centered">Who Are We?</h4>
		<p class="centered">We are the RMS (Ridgely Middle School) Robotics team! We create, program, and then compete with robots.<br> we have multiple IQ teams along with a couple of VCR teams, because of this we compete with many high school teams.<br> Our teams have won many competitions and have gone to states and some have even made it to worlds!</p>
		<div class="border-bottom"></div><br>
		<h4 class="centered">​How has COVID affected us?</h4>
		<p class="centered">We are currently adjusting to the COVID situation by making robotics fully online, this way we are unable to build vex robots, but we are able to participate in online challenges.<br> We have groups that are each doing different Vex Online Challenges, this way we are learning about teamwork,<br> programming and other aspects of robotics that many of us can use in future competitions or life, especially with our 8th graders soon moving on to high school!</p>
		<div class="border-bottom"></div>
		<h4 class="centered">Who are our influencers?</h4>
		<p class="centered">This has been a long journey. All our members in robotics have faced difficult journeys, we've had robots break, codes get deleted, batteries die, etc.<br> Our peers and teacher have guided us through the times where we thought we would lose. Our teacher, Mrs.O'melia has had backup batteries and has given us supplies in the time we need it.<br> She was always there for us. She was always willing to help us and give advice. Our 8th graders were always supporting us behind the scenes as well.<br> If we had a question about the game, they would be the first to answer.</p>
