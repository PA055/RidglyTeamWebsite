		<h4 class="left-align media-clear" style="">Who Are We?</h4>
		<p class="media-clear" style="width: 73%;">We are the RMS (Ridgely Middle School) Robotics team! We create,
			program, and compete with robots against robots. We have multiple IQ teams along with a couple of VRC teams.
			Students who participated in robotics can better succeed in high school and other activities. Our
			teams have won many competitions and gone to states. Some have even gone to worlds!​</p>
		<br>
		<h4 class="" style="">What does Robotics help</h4>
		<p class="">Robotics improves cooperation and teaches kids knowledge about basic programming, design, and the
			processes of trial and error. </p>
		<br>
		<h4 class="">​How has COVID-19 affected us?</h4>
		<p class="">We are adjusting to the COVID situation by meeting online. We are unable to build
			robots this year, but we can participate in online challenges. We have groups that are doing
			different online challenges. To maintain and gain skills, we would like a "normal" robotics session. We will
			continue to help students develop strong characteristics to later help them in high school. </p>
		<br>
		<h4 class="">Who are our influencers?</h4>
		<p class="">This has been a long journey. All of our robotics members have faced difficult journeys.
			We've had robots break, codes get deleted, batteries die, etc. Our peers and teachers have guided us through
			the difficult times when we thought all was lost. Our teachers, Ms. O'Melia and Mr. Kallaur, come to every
			competition
			and practice, giving us advice and support. Our 8th grade members are also assisting behind the scenes. From
			giving examples of old award-winning notebooks to advice on robots or interview questions, they have helped
			us a lot. If we had a
			question about the game, they would be the first to answer using their past experiences. Even some alumni
			still come by to help us learn! Mr. Kallaur and Ms. O'Melia have always made us feel welcome at robotics.

			Last school year (2019-2020) three of our metal teams made it to Worlds by winning the Design Award, winning
			Skills, and becoming
			Tournament Champion. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we were unable to go. We have had VEX IQ get into
			states as well, but because of COVID-19, teams are not allowed to
			go this year. In the 2017-2018 school year, all 9 teams qualified for states.
			Everybody was extremely happy. All teams had won the Design Award while 952J had won the Design and Teamwork
			Challenge Award.

		<p class="">Ridgely offers both IQ and VCR teams. The IQ teams consist of 6th and 7th graders while the
			VRC teams comprise of 8th and some lucky 7th graders. You will learn how to code, build, and take
			organized notes in engineering notebooks. The majority of our teams are very successful. most make it to the
			states
			and some into worlds!</p>
		<p></p>
		<h4 class="">Vex IQ</h4>
		<br>
		<p class="">Unfortunately, we cannot have official teams this year due to COVID-19, but we had
			experienced many things last year that helped us grow. Last year, an IQ team was able to get 102 points at a
			competition. That team was called 952G. They went through many variations of robots. At the last
			competition, the team had not expected to score 60 points. 952G had lost most of their hope due to losing
			their past competitions, but their hard work had finally gotten them somewhere. 952G worked hard with their
			allies to rack up points and found that they had qualified for the finals. 952G worked efficiently with
			their allies and racked up many points. In the end, they scored 102 points! Even though 952G came in second
			place, their hope and morale was boosted. The team learned a lot and came into metal stronger than ever!​​</p>

		<p class="">Ridgely Robotics is located at 121 E Ridgely Rd, Lutherville Timonium, MD 21093. The
			robotics club allows 6th, 7th, & 8th graders to join after going through a try-out that normally happens
			around October. If you wish to join a VRC team you must have at least one year of experience with Ridgely
			Robotics. Anyone who passes the audition starts on an IQ team. Ridgely also offers a robotics
			summer camp in the case that you aren't zoned for Ridgely Middle School. For more information, you can go to
			the LTRC website or contact Ridgely Middle School. Through this club you can make new friends, work on
			communication and cooperation while having fun with the competitive game. Hope to see you there! Please
			refer to the 'Help Us' page to reach the Ridgely Middle School Official Website for more information!</p>
