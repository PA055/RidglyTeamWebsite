		<h4 class="centered">Who Are We?</h4>
		<p class="">We are the RMS (Ridgely Middle School) Robotics team! We create, program, and then compete with robots. we have multiple IQ teams along with a couple of VCR teams. With this ground base, students who participated in robotics, can do well in high school and other activities. Our teams have won many competitions and have gone to states. Some have even gone to worlds!​</p>
		<!-- <div class="border-bottom"></div><br> -->
		<br>
		<h4 class="centered">​How has COVID affected us?</h4>
		<p class="centered">We are adjusting to the COVID situation by doing programming online. We are unable to build robots this year but, we can participate in online challenges. We have groups that are each doing a different Vex Online Challenge, to maintain and gain skills we would like a 'normal' robotics session. This will continue to help students develop strong characteristics to later help them in high school. </p>
		<!-- <div class="border-bottom"></div> -->
		<br>
		<h4 class="centered">Who are our influencers?</h4>
		<p class="centered">This has been a long journey. All our members in robotics have faced difficult journeys. We've had robots break, codes get deleted, batteries die, etc. Our peers and teacher have guided us through the times when we thought all was lost. Our teachers, Ms. O'Melia and Mr. Kallaur come to every competition and practice, giving us advice and support. Our 8th grade seniors are also assisting  behind the scenes. From giving examples of old award-winning notebooks to advice on robots or interview questions. If we had a question about the game, they would be the first to answer, using their past experiences. Even some alumni still come by to help us learn! Our coaches, Mr. Kallaur and Ms. O'Melia have always been making it feel as if robotics is our second home.</p>

		<p class="centered">Last school year (2019-2020) three of our metal teams made it to Worlds through Design Award, Skills, and Tournament Champion. Unfortunately due to COVID 19, we were unable to go. One team from VEX IQ qualified the year before, our IQ teams were very successful.  Every one one of our teams made it to states and one of them qualified for worlds along with the VCR teams. We have been going to worlds for the past fifteen years.​<br><br>We have had VEX IQ get into states as well, but because of COVID-19, teams are not allowed to go this year. In the 2017-2018 school year, there was a time when all 9 teams qualified for states. Everybody was extremely happy. All teams had won the Design Award while 952J had won the Design and Teamwork Challenge Award. </p>

		<p class="centered">Ridgely offers both IQ and VCR teams. The IQ teams consist of 6th and 7th graders while the VCR teams are comprised of 8th and some lucky 7th graders. You will learn how to code, build, and take organized notes in engineering notebooks. Most of our teams are very successful; some make it to the states and sometimes into worlds!</p>

		<p class="centered">Unfortunately, we aren't allowed to have official teams. Last year an IQ team was able to get 102 points at a competition. That team was called 952G. We went through many variations of the robot. At the last  competition, the team had not expected to reach 60 points. 952G had lost most of their hope because of losing their past competitions. But we realized that our work had gotten us somewhere. 952G worked hard with their allies to rack up points.  The team soon realized they were qualified to be in the finals. Both teams worked efficiently and with both drivers being able to rack up enough points, they got 102 points in the end! But even though 952G came second place,  their hope and confidence was boosted. The team learned a lot and came into metal stronger than ever!​ <br><br>Another experience was two years ago with 952J. They went through many challenges throughout the year, they had made PowerPoints and practiced interviews, they made improvements to their robot multiple times throughout the years. They had one competition where while holding the robot it completely fell apart about five minutes before their first competition and only two members were in attendance of that meet, so they both had to work together and made a quick push-bot that would support their alliance and allow them to get more points, they remained in the top ten teams for a while but in the end, they were placed in around twentieth. Overall they did a very good job but sadly they didn't qualify for states yet and they only had one more competition left. In their last competition one team member was unfortunately unable to make it, but this didn't stop them they made a PowerPoint to present to the judges explaining their plans, strategies, each members strength and weakness, along with any hardships they faced or future improvements hey were willing to make, they had practiced interview questions and strategies so they could make a good impression on the judges, this allowed them to get a second interview with someone else after all they could do was wait. During this they had about seven competitions and they participated in skills and got very high points. This competition was probably there most successful out of all, they were paired with good teams that both leaned on each other, they were able to get into the finals in eleventh place! They had one more competition left, and they were placed with a team that was relatively equal to them and they got the all of the bonus points and were able to run a very perfect match and their score was even better, they were now in first place but there were still teams that had to compete. Lucky for them no one was able to get higher than them, so they had just won the Teamwork Challenge, and because of this since they were first in states and a different RMS team was second, they were able to qualify as well. 952J also won the design award in that competition. When they went to states they made fortieth out of forty-two, but they still had fun and one RMS Robotics team was able to qualify for worlds that year along with the VCR teams that had already participated in states. Overall 952J had fun that year and learned a lot!​</p>

		<p class="centered">Ridgely Robotics is located at 121 E Ridgely Rd, Lutherville Timonium, MD 21093. The robotics club allows 6th, 7th, & 8th graders to join after going through a try-out that normally happens around October. If you wish to join a VCR team you must have at least one year of experience with Ridgely Robotics. For IQ teams, anyone who has passed the application, begins here. Ridgely also offers a robotics summer camp in case you aren't zoned for Ridgely Middle School. To get information about this, you can go to the LTRC website or contact Ridgely Middle School. Through this club you can make new friends, work on communication and teamwork skills while still having fun and being competitive. Hope to see you there!
